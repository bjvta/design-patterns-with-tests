# Learning Design Pattern with Tests

This repo is supposed to show some minimum example of the following patterns

- Singleton
    - [ruby](lib/ruby/singleton)

and on each folder we will try to add more than one language, for now we will start with Ruby

## Setup the dev environment

### Install Ruby and gems

You can use [rvm](https://rvm.io/rvm/install) or [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) to manage your ruby versions.

```
rvm install ruby-3.0.6
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

### Running tests

```
rspec spec
```

## Support

Feel free to add the design you have known with tests.

Happy Coding!
